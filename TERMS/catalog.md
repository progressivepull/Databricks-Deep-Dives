**📚 What a *Catalog* Is in Databricks**

A **catalog** is the **highest-level container** for organizing data in
**Unity Catalog**, Databricks’ centralized governance layer. It sits at
the top of the three‑level namespace:

``` Code

catalog.schema.table

``` 


Think of it as the **root folder** that controls access, isolation, and
governance for everything inside it.

**🧱 How Catalogs Fit Into the Databricks Hierarchy**

| **Level**                                    | **Example**             | **Purpose**                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Catalog**                                  | main, dev, finance      | Data isolation + governance boundary |
| **Schema**                                   | sales, raw, analytics   | Logical grouping of objects          |
| **Table / View / Volume / Function / Model** | transactions, customers | Actual data or compute objects       |

Catalogs live inside a **Unity Catalog metastore**, which is registered
to your Databricks account.

**🎯 Why Catalogs Matter**

**1. Data Isolation**

Each catalog can represent:

- a business domain (finance, marketing)

- an environment (dev, test, prod)

- a compliance boundary (PII vs non‑PII)

This lets you cleanly separate who can see what.

**2. Access Control**

Catalogs support **catalog‑level privileges**, so you can grant or
restrict access at the highest level and inherit downward.

**3. Governance Consistency**

Unity Catalog enforces:

- centralized permissions

- lineage

- auditing

- consistent security across clouds

**🛠️ What You Can Store in a Catalog**

Inside each catalog you can have:

- Schemas

- Tables (managed or external)

- Views

- Volumes

- Functions

- ML models

All governed under the same security model.

**🧩 Best Practices for Organizing Catalogs**

Databricks recommends designing catalogs around **logical isolation
boundaries**, such as:

**✔️ By environment**

- dev

- test

- prod

**✔️ By business domain**

- finance

- sales

- marketing

**✔️ By data sensitivity**

- pii

- non_pii

This makes permissioning clean and scalable.

**🧠 Quick Mental Model**

A catalog is the **governance root**. A schema is the **organizational
folder**. A table is the **actual data**.
